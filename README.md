# House-Price-Prediction
This was my first ML project
<br>
It is a simple supervised machine learning regression algorithm that predicts the house prices of a certain
location. I have acquired the dataset from Kaggle. Then after performing some EDA techniques I trained Random Forest Regressor have used Grid Search CV for hyper parameter tuning. I have also built a pipeline for train and test datasets.

Feel free to suggest any better approach to tackle the problem or any better techniques for visualizing the data and outlier removal.
